Next steps:

1. Configure the mailer to create full URLs in emails:

    # config/environments/{development,test}.rb
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000' }

    In the production environment it should be your application's full hostname.

2. Display user session status somewhere in the views.

    The views installer can be run with `rails generate clearance:views` and
    will install a partial in `application/header` which includes code suitable
    for basic display of conditional sign in and sign out links. You can use
    `<%= render "header" %>` from your layout to use that partial, and then
    customize as appropriate for your application.

3. Render the flash contents.

    Make sure the flash is being rendered in your views using something like:

    <div id="flash">
      <% flash.each do |key, value| %>
        <div class="flash <%= key %>"><%= value %></div>
      <% end %>
    </div>

4. Migrate:

    Run `rails db:migrate` to add the clearance database changes.
